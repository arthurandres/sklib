  - request(s):
    - frist round:
      - locals, departure, inbound, outbound
    - second round:
      - same with airports
    - do filtering on client
  - replies:
    - first round: just prices (and direct option)
    - second round: all the data + status of query per airport

  - airports and town
- Naming:
  - Request
  - Reply
  - Do not use Query
  - normalize inbound/outbound vs departure / return
  - normalize key/api key
